# File type plugins
This is a collection of plugins providing filetype-specific tools
for editing various documents. The `plugin` features require
[vim-text-obj]() and [surround.vim]().



  # Installation
  Install with your favorite [plugin manager](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/388/what-is-the-difference-between-the-vim-plugin-managers).
  I highly recommend the [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)` manager,
  in which case you can install this plugin by adding
  ```
  Plug 'lukelbd/vim-ftplugins'
  ```
  to your `.vimrc`.
